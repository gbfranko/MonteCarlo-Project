## Synopsis
This repo has a package for a die game. When given faces it can roll any amount of similar die (meaning they have the same faces) any number of times. The weights of the die can be changed to give certain faces advantages in a roll. Using it you can return a few things such as the number for each face for a game, the number of each combonation of faces for a game, and number of jackpots for a game (number of rolls where all faces are the same).
